# TODO: Connect Django Project to MySQL Database

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update settings.py to use environment variables for database credentials instead of hardcoding
- [x] Edit .env file to include MySQL database environment variables (DB_ENGINE, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT)
- [ ] Verify MySQL server is running
- [ ] Create the 'assets_db' database in MySQL if it doesn't exist
- [x] Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt
- [ ] Run Django migrations to set up the database schema
- [ ] Test the connection by running the Django development server

## Notes
- User has confirmed MySQL and dependencies are installed.
- Ensure .env file is not committed to version control for security.
